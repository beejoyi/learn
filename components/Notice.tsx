/**
 * A short message beside the control that produced it — a failed save, a rejected value, a result
 * worth a sentence. Seven places used to hand-roll this same paragraph; they all render it now, so
 * the tone, size and announcement stay the same wherever it appears.
 *
 * `error` announces immediately (role="alert"), because something the user asked for did not
 * happen. `info` and `ok` wait their turn (role="status"), and `info` keeps the muted tone used for
 * "nothing matched" results, which are answers rather than faults.
 *
 * For feedback with no control to sit beside — the control has scrolled away, or there is no room —
 * use `toast()` from components/Toast instead.
